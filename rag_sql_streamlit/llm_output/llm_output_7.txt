Here are the outputs:

1) -- Final Query
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM film 
WHERE film.title IS NOT NULL;
```

2) -- Insert into queries_log
```sql
INSERT INTO queries_log (question, description, sql_text, created_at)
VALUES ('How many movies are they ?', 'Number of movies', 'SELECT COUNT(*) FROM film WHERE film.title IS NOT NULL;', NOW());
```

3) -- Create or replace view
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW movie_count AS 
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM film 
WHERE film.title IS NOT NULL;
```

4) -- Insert into generated_views
```sql
INSERT INTO generated_views (view_id, query_id, view_name, created_at)
VALUES (DEFAULT, LAST_INSERT_ID(), 'movie_count', NOW());
```

Please note that I've assumed the question is referring to the "film" table in the schema context.
