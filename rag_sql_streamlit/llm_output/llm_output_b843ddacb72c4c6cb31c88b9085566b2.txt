Here are the four code blocks:

1) -- Final Query
```sql
SELECT UPPER(CONCAT(a.first_name, ' ', a.last_name)) AS "Actor Name"
FROM actor a;
```

2) -- Insert into queries_log
```sql
INSERT INTO queries_log (question, description, sql_text, created_at)
VALUES ('Create a list of all the actorsâ€™ first name and last name. Display the first and last name of each actor in a single column in upper case letters. Name the column Actor Name.', 
         'Retrieves the names of all actors, formatting them as "Actor Name".', 
         'SELECT UPPER(CONCAT(a.first_name, '' , a.last_name)) AS ''Actor Name'' FROM actor a;', 
         NOW());
```

3) -- Create or replace view
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW actor_names AS
SELECT UPPER(CONCAT(a.first_name, ' ', a.last_name)) AS "Actor Name"
FROM actor a;
```

4) -- Insert into generated_views
```sql
INSERT INTO generated_views (view_name, query_id, created_at)
VALUES ('actor_names', 1, NOW());
```
