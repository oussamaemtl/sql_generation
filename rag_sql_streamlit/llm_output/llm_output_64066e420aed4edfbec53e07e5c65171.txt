1) -- Final Query
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM film;
```

2) -- Insert into queries_log
```sql
INSERT INTO queries_log (question, description, sql_text, created_at)
VALUES ('How many films are there ?', 'Counts the number of films in the database.', 'SELECT COUNT(*) FROM film;', NOW());
```

3) -- Create or replace view
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW total_film_count AS 
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM film;
```

4) -- Insert into generated_views
```sql
INSERT INTO generated_views (view_id, query_id, view_name, created_at)
VALUES (DEFAULT, 1, 'total_film_count', NOW());
```

Note: I assumed that the user question "How many films are there?" is equivalent to counting the number of films in the database.
