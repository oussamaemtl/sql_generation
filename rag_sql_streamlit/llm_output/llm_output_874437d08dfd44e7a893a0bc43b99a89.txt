Here are the four code blocks:

1) -- Final Query
```sql
SELECT UPPER(CONCAT(a.first_name, ' ', a.last_name)) AS "Actor Name"
FROM actor a;
```

2) -- Insert into queries_log
```sql
INSERT INTO queries_log (question, description, sql_text, created_at)
VALUES ('Create a list of all the actors first name and last name. Display the first and last name of each actor in a single column in upper case letters. Name the column Actor Name.', 'Retrieves the names of all actors, formatting them as "Actor Name".', 
'SELECT UPPER(CONCAT(a.first_name, '' '', a.last_name)) AS ''Actor Name'' FROM actor a;', NOW());
```

3) -- Create or replace view
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW joe_actor AS
SELECT UPPER(CONCAT(a.first_name, ' ', a.last_name)) AS "Actor Name"
FROM actor a;
```

4) -- Insert into generated_views
```sql
INSERT INTO generated_views (view_id, query_id, view_name, created_at)
VALUES (DEFAULT, 8, 'joe_actor', NOW());
```

Note: I used the exact user question and SQL query from the problem statement, and also included the query_id in the insert into generated_views statement, as it is not specified which query_id to use.
