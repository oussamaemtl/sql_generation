Here are the outputs for the four code blocks:

1) -- Final Query
```sql
SELECT UPPER(CONCAT(staff.first_name, ' ', staff.last_name)) AS "Actor Name"
FROM staff;
```

2) -- Insert into queries_log
```sql
INSERT INTO queries_log (question, description, sql_text, created_at)
VALUES ('Create a list of all the actorsâ€™ first name and last name. Display the first and last name of each actor in a single column in upper case letters. Name the column Actor Name.', 'Retrieves the names of all actors, formatting them as "Actor Name".', 
'SELECT UPPER(CONCAT(staff.first_name, '' , staff.last_name)) AS ''Actor Name'' FROM staff;', NOW());
```

3) -- Create or replace view
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW Actor_View AS
SELECT UPPER(CONCAT(staff.first_name, ' ', staff.last_name)) AS "Actor Name"
FROM staff;
```

4) -- Insert into generated_views
```sql
INSERT INTO generated_views (view_id, query_id, view_name, created_at)
VALUES ((SELECT COALESCE(MAX(view_id), 0) + 1 FROM generated_views), (SELECT query_id FROM queries_log ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1), 'Actor_View', NOW());
```
